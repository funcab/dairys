### 1.create table
```
row format delimited
fields terminated by '|'
lines terminated by '\n'
stored as textfile;
```

2.when use beeline

run="/home/edc_jk/sparkForThrift/bin/beeline -u \"jdbc:hive2://hnedaint06:10001/default;principal=edc_jk/admin@NBDP.COM\""
${run}<<EOF
${vsql}
!exit
EOF

3.judge is empty or not

trim: remove a blank each for side left and right
''  :length(xxx) <> 0
null:is not null

if a='',then a is not null,but a is empty,so we use length(a)<>0 to limit a is not empty;
if a=null,then a is not null,and a is empty at the same time.
so to limit a is not empty,use length(trim(a))<>0 and a is not null

4.about join

(inner) join
Left/right/full (outer) join [where â€¦]

semi join
it serves for the situation that table a to aquire datas which agree conditions refer to table b
finally,it only will return table a's selected datas
fammiliar to in/exsits's usage

map join

set hive.auto.convert.join = true; #default false
on this setting,the script will use map join automatically at little table circumstances
